This C++ code is an image processing program that allows the user to load an image, apply filters, and save the modified image. Here's a brief description of its functionality:

 **Menu**: After loading the image, the program displays a menu with several options:
   - Flip Image: Allows the user to flip the image horizontally or vertically.
   - Apply Black and White Filter: Converts the image to black and white.
   - Save Image: Saves the modified image with the same filename or a new filename.
   - Exit: Terminates the program.
